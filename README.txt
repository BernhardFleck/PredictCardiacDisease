About it: 
------------------------------------------------------
Cardiovascular disease accounts for a large proportion of deaths worldwide.
To avoid serious consequences, action must be taken as quickly as possible. If diagnosed in
time, diagnoses can usually be treated well. To help paramedics make the correct diagnosis
and to reduce time it takes for the right treatment to happen, a machine learning algorithm
was developed. 
Our goal is to develop a machine learning assisted solution to support paramedics in a
prehospital emergency setting to help them in finding the correct diagnosis regarding patients
with a cardiovascular disease. The paramedics enter specific symptoms of the patient on a
website and then receive a diagnosis that matches the entered symptoms so they can act as
quickly as possible.
